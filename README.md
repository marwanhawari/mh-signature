# Description
An HTML element for my signature.

# Usage
To include it in the HTML, import it in the HTML head with a script tag:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/marwanhawari/mh-signature/src/mh-signature.js" defer ></script>
```

Then use the `mh-signature` id with the element where it should be placed. Usually this is near the end of the page:
```html
<div id="mh-signature"></div>
```
